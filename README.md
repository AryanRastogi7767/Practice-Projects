# Practice-Projects
1. The Data Anaysis Project on app store data : It is to find out features in a strategy game that effect the game's rating majorly and what are the attributes to create a strategy game that has Average User Rating greater than or equal to 4.      --Jan 2020

2. Ecommerce Fraud Detection Project is a project on binary classification using Random Forests Classification ,Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines on Ecommerce Transactions Data.                                                         --Feb 2020

3. Disaster Tweets Classification Project was a part of Kaggle Competition in which I had to perform binary classification on text data.
This project has been made for practising  NLP, text featurization and basic ML algorithms for binary classification on high dimensional data.                                                                                                           --April 2020

4. Titanic Survival Prediction Project was a part of Kaggle Competition consists of univariate feature analysis and visualisations along with key insights on the data. The task was to predict that a passenger will survive or not using the given data on the passengers.
I used classical machine learning algorithms along with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to get the final output. --May 2020

5. Census Income Prediction and Analysis Project : It contains a detailed analysis and visualizations of the features of the census income dataset from UCI Machine learning Repository. It also consists of detailed feature engineering and prediction modelling to find a good classifier for the data.  -- June 2020
